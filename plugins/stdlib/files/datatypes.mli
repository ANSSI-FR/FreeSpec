val coqfd_t : Constr.constr

(** Add an OCaml file descriptor to the resource manager, and create a Coq term
    to manipulate it later.

    After the execution of [make_coqfd fd], the file descriptor [fd] is being
    stored in FreeSpec.Exec resource manager. The Coq term returned by the
    function is a Coq native integer whose value is [fd]'s key chosen by the
    resource manager.

    This function should only be called once, for fresh file descriptors created
    by functions like [open]. Currently, there is no way to retrieve the Coq
    term associated with a file descriptor already open. *)

val make_coqfd : Unix.file_descr -> Constr.t

(** Remove an OCaml file descriptor identified by the given Coq native integer
    from the resource manager contents.

    This function expects its first argument to be a Coq native integer. This is
    potentially unsafe if the key used has been freed or has not been used to
    store a file descriptor, but something else. The file descriptor removed
    from the resource manager is returned. *)

val destruct_coqfd : Constr.t -> Unix.file_descr

(** Retrieve the OCaml file descriptor associated with a given Coq native
    integer.

    This function expects its first argument to be a Coq native integer. It uses
    this integer as a key for the resource manager, to retrieve a file
    descriptor previously stored using this key. This is potentially unsafe if
    the key used has been freed or has not been used to store a file descriptor,
    but something else. *)
