   An initializer binds the constructor identifier of the interface
   request to an OCaml function that implements its semantics.

   To register a new interface, a plugin must install an initializer
   that will be triggered at [Exec] time. The initializer cannot be
   run at [Declare Module] time because the identifiers of the
   constructors might not be properly bound in Coq environment at this
   moment.
