(** * The Shameful [Undefined] Interface

    Using the [Undefined] interface, you can pledge guilty of having
    undefined behaviour in your formal specification.

    ** Definition

    *)

Inductive Undefined
  : Interface :=
| undefined {A: Type}
  : Undefined A.

(** ** Why using an Interface?

    We use an Interface to deal with Undefined Behaviour for at least
    two reasons:

      - It makes obvious that a given Semantics uses the [undefined]
        effect
      - It is easier to write a specification to check if [undefined]
        is called

    * [UndefMonad] Typeclass

    The UndefMonad is here to provide an easier way to work with
    undefined behaviour. Indeed, this library provides the required
    typeclass instances so that if the [Undefined] Interface is used,
    the [undef] primitive is available on the top of the monad stack
    (that is, after the composition of the Interfaces and the use of a
    State Monad).
