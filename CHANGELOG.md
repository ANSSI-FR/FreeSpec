# ChangeLog

## `freespec-r2` (unreleased)

* Monad-related definitions have been moved into another library called
  [`coq-prelude`](https:github.com/ANSSI-FR/coq-prelude), to ease its use by
  other projects.
* Provide an alternative to the composition operators in form of datatypes for
  typeclass-constrained effects. The main source of inspiration of this
  implementation is *[Extensible Effects, An Alternative to Monad
  Transformers](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf)*.

## `freespec-r1`

This is the first public release of FreeSpec. The content of the source tree
matches the formalism and framework which have been described in an academic
paper submitted to the Formal Methods 2018 conference.
